##Part 3
1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

  Probably not, the messaging feature seems very intensive and requires a lot of various components to interact with each other in order for a user to message another user. Seems to complicated to be able to be tested with a unit test.

2. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

   Yes, the max message length feature seems very easy to test as you would only need to check the message length provided by the user. There doesn't seem to be a lot of components working around each other.
